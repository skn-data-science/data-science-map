Principal component analysis
============================

Statistical method which is used to reduce number of dimensions of dataset while keeping all vital data. It will make further work easier.

Algorithm using during analysis is based on creating new coordinate system, where each axe refers to one variable in dataset. We can determine them through maximizing variance (minimalizing error â€“ [MAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error)) towards respective directions, each of them is called principal component. Values set on successive principal component will be less diverse and it will allow us to delete least diverse and relatively consistent ones without losing valuable data.
